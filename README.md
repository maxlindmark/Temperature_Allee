Data and files to reproduce the analysis in Lindmark et al 2018

### To reproduce the figures 
... based on the simulated data, please see the folder "R" which uses already simulated and saved data, stored in folder "Data"

### To see how the model is implemented in matcont
... see "MatLab_MatCont_model_files", "msII_Paper_MatCont_implementation.txt"

### To open the model in MatCont GUI and re-export or check simulated curves
... follow the instructions below.

#### Navigate to folder MatLab_MatCont_model_files:
The zip-file contains files for opening the model in MatCont GUI to redo analysis or re-export data used for plotting (see Data and R folders):

The zip-file contains the following:
1) The computed curves (Diagrams)
2) msII_Paper.mat
3) msII_Paper.m (This is the model generated by MatCont GUI)

Steps:
Install MatLab and MatCont (https://sourceforge.net/projects/matcont/)
You will need the student version or any version that contains the symbolic package. This is needed to use the heavyside function that is implementeted in the maturation function, see text file with "model implementations") and MatCont

1. To open the model, to view the computed equilibrium curves and to use the matlab code below to export data as .csv do like this: 
2. Navigate to the "systems" folder in your MATLAB directory (MATLAB -> matcont -> systems) 
3. Unzip the file "msII_Paper"
4. Drag the unzipped contents (1) "msII_Paper" folder, (2) the msII_Paper.mat and (3) the msII_Paper.m files to the "systems" folder in your MatLab folder, see above
5. Open MatCont by typing matcont in the MATLAB command window.
6. Now you can open all the diagrams and view them in matlab or use the MatLab code in the "MatLab_MatCont_model_files" folder to export the diagrams as .csv files locally (*Note, change file path!)
